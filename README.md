This is the main code base for [my blog](https://blog.maximeheckel.com).
After a pit stop on Medium, I built it from scratch using GatbsyJS but decided in early 2020 to migrate it to the NextJS framework.

It's also built using

- Emotion / CSS
- MDX
- Netlify

Design is handmade (I may release a personal Design System at some point).
